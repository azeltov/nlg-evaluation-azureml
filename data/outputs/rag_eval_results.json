Navy Pier encompasses over 50 acres (20\u00a0ha) of shops, restaurants, live theaters, family attractions, parks (including Polk Bros Park), gardens, and exhibition facilities and is one of the top destinations in the Midwestern United States, drawing over nine million visitors annually.[2][3] It is one of the most visited attractions in the entire Midwest and is Chicago's second-most visited tourist attraction.[2][4]. Navy Pier opened to the public on July 15, 1916.[5] Originally known as the \"Municipal Pier\", the pier was built by Charles Sumner Frost, a nationally known architect, with a design based on the 1909 Plan of Chicago by  Daniel Burnham and Edward H. Bennett[6] Its original purpose was to serve as a dock for freighters, passenger ships, and indoor and outdoor recreation; events like expositions and pageants were held there.. In mid-1918, the pier was also used as a jail for draft dodgers. In 1927, the pier was renamed Navy Pier to honor the naval veterans who served in World War I.[7]. In 1941, during World War II, the pier became a training center for the United States Navy; about 10,000 people worked, trained and lived there. The pier contained a 2,500-seat theater, gym, 12-chair barber shop, tailor, cobbler shops, soda fountain and a vast kitchen and hospital.[8][9]. Beginning in 1946, as the Navy was winding down from its mission, the University of Illinois held classes at the pier, especially to serve the high demand from returning service members.

Best known for being the location of Six Flags Great America, Six Flags Hurricane Harbor Chicago and Gurnee Mills, the village sees an average of over 23 million visitors annually.[3]. Early settlers in the Gurnee area came by foot horseback and by \"Prairie Schooners\" drawn by oxen or via the Erie Canal and the Great Lakes. They came from the town of Warren, New York, which was named in honor of Major General Joseph Warren, killed at the Battle of Bunker Hill. Warren Township, formed in 1850, was also named after him.[4] The first settlement of Warren Township commenced in 1835 in the vicinity of the Aux Plaines River (now the Des Plaines River).. In 1835\u201336, a land company from New York State erected a Community House (site of the old Gurnee Grade School) to accommodate families while they were locating and getting government land grants to their farms. Near the Community House, there was a ford used by the Potowatomi Indians for crossing the river. A floating log bridge was built in 1842.

Navy Pier encompasses over 50 acres (20\u00a0ha) of shops, restaurants, live theaters, family attractions, parks (including Polk Bros Park), gardens, and exhibition facilities and is one of the top destinations in the Midwestern United States, drawing over nine million visitors annually.[2][3] It is one of the most visited attractions in the entire Midwest and is Chicago's second-most visited tourist attraction.[2][4]. Navy Pier opened to the public on July 15, 1916.[5] Originally known as the \"Municipal Pier\", the pier was built by Charles Sumner Frost, a nationally known architect, with a design based on the 1909 Plan of Chicago by  Daniel Burnham and Edward H. Bennett[6] Its original purpose was to serve as a dock for freighters, passenger ships, and indoor and outdoor recreation; events like expositions and pageants were held there.. In mid-1918, the pier was also used as a jail for draft dodgers. In 1927, the pier was renamed Navy Pier to honor the naval veterans who served in World War I.[7]. In 1941, during World War II, the pier became a training center for the United States Navy; about 10,000 people worked, trained and lived there. The pier contained a 2,500-seat theater, gym, 12-chair barber shop, tailor, cobbler shops, soda fountain and a vast kitchen and hospital.[8][9]. Beginning in 1946, as the Navy was winding down from its mission, the University of Illinois held classes at the pier, especially to serve the high demand from returning service members. As the maximum capacity was exceeded, the school outgrew the pier, the University of Illinois at Chicago was partly founded as a result.[10] After the university left, the Navy Pier became underutilized..\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=Navy Pier ", "groundedness_answer": "1", "goundedness_question": "5", "question_context_sim": 0.6975329888606704, "answer_context_sim": 0.9088823820150534}, {"question": "How do earthquakes happen?", "answer": "Chicago, Illinois, offers a wide array of tourist attractions.

Its population was 30,706 as of the 2020 census.[2] It borders the city of Waukegan, and is a popular tourist attraction within the Chicago metropolitan area.. Best known for being the location of Six Flags Great America, Six Flags Hurricane Harbor Chicago and Gurnee Mills, the village sees an average of over 23 million visitors annually.[3]. Early settlers in the Gurnee area came by foot horseback and by \"Prairie Schooners\" drawn by oxen or via the Erie Canal and the Great Lakes. They came from the town of Warren, New York, which was named in honor of Major General Joseph Warren, killed at the Battle of Bunker Hill. Warren Township, formed in 1850, was also named after him.[4] The first settlement of Warren Township commenced in 1835 in the vicinity of the Aux Plaines River (now the Des Plaines River).. In 1835\u201336, a land company from New York State erected a Community House (site of the old Gurnee Grade School) to accommodate families while they were locating and getting government land grants to their farms. Near the Community House, there was a ford used by the Potowatomi Indians for crossing the river. A floating log bridge was built in 1842. Later, both a wood and iron bridge were built..\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=Gurnee, Illinois ", "groundedness_answer": "1", "goundedness_question": "5", "question_context_sim": 0.7049970290243577, "answer_context_sim": 0.8375263385852496}]
