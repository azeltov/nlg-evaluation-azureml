[{"question": "How do volcanoes erupt?", "answer": "Volcanoes erupt when lava, tephra (which includes ash, lapilli, volcanic bombs, and volcanic blocks), and various gases are expelled from a volcanic vent or fissure. This can occur through three main mechanisms. The strength of an eruption can be measured using the Volcanic Explosivity Index, which is an order-of-magnitude scale that ranges from 0 to 8 and often correlates with the types of eruptions.
