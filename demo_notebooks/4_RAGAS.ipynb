    "# **Evaluating Natural Language Generation w/ RAGAS**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "In this notebook you will explore the RAGAS (by ExplodingGradients) open source NLG evaluation framework. Ragas aims to create an open standard, providing developers with the tools and techniques to leverage continual learning in their RAG applications. using RAGAS for NLG evaluation you will be able to evaluate each component of your RAG pipeline in isolation. RAGAS primarily uses 4 core metrics:\n",
    "1. Faithfulness: How factually accurate a generated answer is\n",
    "2. Answer Relevence: How relevent an answer is to the question\n",
    "3. Context Precision: The signal to noise ration fo the retreived context\n",
    "4. Context Recall: Is all required relevant information retreived to answer the question (_requires ground truth_)\n",
    "\n",
    "_Notes_  \n",
    "- For this notebook, we will use 30 smaples from the [FIQA](https://sites.google.com/view/fiqa/) public dataset from ExplodingGradients\n",
    "  - _Schema_ = question,ground_truths,answer,contexts\n",
    "- For this notebook we will use the previously established Azure OpenAI connection, however a regular OpenAI connection can also be used\n",
