    "1. Synthetically generate a diverse test dataset that you can use to evaluate your app.\n",
    "2. Use LLM-assisted evaluation metrics designed to help you objectively measure the performance of your application.\n",
    "3. Monitor the quality of your apps in production using smaller, cheaper models that can give actionable insights. For example, the number of hallucinations in the generated answer.\n",
    "4. Use these insights to iterate and improve your application.\n",
