    "### Overview\n",
    "In this demonstration, you will evaluate the output of a simple chat LLM using an LLM. In this case, you will use GPT35-turbo-instruct to evaluate chat outputs for the following metrics:\n",
    "1. **Fluency** - Measures how grammatically and linguistically correct the model's predicted answer is.\n",
    "2. **Coherence** - Measures the quality of all sentences in a model's predicted answer and how they fit together naturally.\n",
    "3. **Relevance** - Measures how relevant the model's predicted answers are to the questions asked.\n",
    "\n",
    "After utilizing Azure PromptFlow to generate and evaluate chat responses, this notebook will take a deeper look at the results.\n",
