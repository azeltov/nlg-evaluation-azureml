    default: "To use the Azure Machine Learning Python SDK v2, you first need to
      install it. You can do this in two ways:\\n\\n1. Create a compute
      instance, which automatically installs the SDK and is pre-configured for
      ML workflows. For more information, see the guide on how to create and
      manage an Azure Machine Learning compute instance.\\n\\n2. Use the
      following commands to install Azure ML Python SDK v2:\\n   * Uninstall
      previous preview version:\\n   ```python\\n   pip uninstall
      azure-ai-ml\\n   ```\\n   * Install the Azure ML Python SDK
      v2:\\n   ```python\\n   pip install azure-ai-ml\\n   ```\\n\\nAfter
      installation, you can use the SDK to train computer vision models on image
      data with automated ML with the Azure Machine Learning CLI extension v2 or
      the Azure Machine Learning Python SDK v2 (Source:
